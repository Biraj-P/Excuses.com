## ⚠️ GitHub Pages Limitation

**Note:** When deployed to GitHub Pages, the application cannot directly access the Together API due to CORS restrictions. The app includes a robust fallback mechanism that automatically:

1. Detects the GitHub Pages environment
2. Displays informative notifications to users
3. Switches to a local database of high-quality, categorized excuses 
4. Maintains a consistent user experience with visual indicators

This ensures that your application works smoothly regardless of hosting platform, with the most advanced features available based on environment capabilities.

For full AI functionality with Meta-Llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free, deploy this application to:
- Netlify with serverless functions (recommended)
- Vercel with API routes
- Your own server with proper CORS configuration

See the [Deployment Guide](deploy.html) for detailed instructions.

## How It Works

The user enters a description of their situation, and our sophisticated excuse generator will create a plausible and relevant excuse. The system uses Together API's Meta-Llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model for generating creative and contextually appropriate excuses.

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Together API key
3. Open `index.html` in your browser using a local server (due to API requests)
4. Start generating excuses!

## Together API Setup

1. Sign up for an account at [Together](https://www.together.ai/)
2. Generate an API key from your account settings
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file or directly in the script.js file
4. Make sure to protect your API key and not expose it in public repositories
