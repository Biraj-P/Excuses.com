# Excuses.com

A simple, elegant excuse generator for those moments when you need the perfect alibi.

**Live Demo:** [https://biraj-p.github.io/excuses-generator/](https://biraj-p.github.io/excuses-generator/)

## Features

- Simple and clean user interface
- Generate excuses for various situations instantly
- Integration with Together API and Meta-Llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model for AI-generated excuses
- Pre-built suggestion chips for common scenarios
- Easy copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Mobile-responsive design

## ⚠️ GitHub Pages Limitation

**Note:** When deployed to GitHub Pages, the application cannot directly access the Together API due to CORS restrictions. On GitHub Pages, the app will automatically fall back to using a local database of excuses instead of the AI model.

For full AI functionality, deploy this application to:
- Netlify with serverless functions
- Vercel with API routes
- Your own server with proper CORS configuration

## How It Works

The user enters a description of their situation, and our sophisticated excuse generator will create a plausible and relevant excuse. The system uses Together API's Meta-Llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free model for generating creative and contextually appropriate excuses.

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Together API key
3. Open `index.html` in your browser using a local server (due to API requests)
4. Start generating excuses!

## Together API Setup

1. Sign up for an account at [Together](https://www.together.ai/)
2. Generate an API key from your account settings
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file or directly in the script.js file
4. Make sure to protect your API key and not expose it in public repositories

## Deployment Options

### Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

To deploy this application with full AI functionality on Netlify:

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account
3. From the Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git"
4. Connect to your GitHub account and select this repository
5. In the build settings:
   - Base directory: leave empty
   - Build command: leave empty (no build required)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root of the project)
6. Click "Show advanced" and add the following environment variable:
   - Key: `TOGETHER_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Together API key
7. Click "Deploy site"

After deployment, your site will have full AI functionality with serverless functions handling the API requests securely.

### GitHub Pages (Limited Functionality)

You can deploy to GitHub Pages, but the AI functionality **will not work**. The app will fall back to using the local database of excuses.

1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
2. Set the source to your main branch
3. Wait for deployment to complete

When users visit your GitHub Pages site, they will see a notice explaining that AI functionality is disabled due to platform limitations.

### Custom Server

For a custom server deployment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure your server to serve the static files
3. Set up CORS headers to allow requests to Together API
4. Alternatively, implement a server-side proxy similar to the Netlify function
5. Deploy to your hosting provider
